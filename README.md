# Unit-2-ORBITZ.COM
The experience I got from my first collaborative project of building a clone of ORBITZ .COM
HomePage:


Orbitz.com is a travel fare aggregator website and travel metasearch engine. Orbitz Worldwide, Inc., a subsidiary of Expedia Group, owns the website.

Online travel booking site Orbitz has rolled out a mobile-exclusive daily dealâ€¦ mobile site that targets travelers looking for last-minute bargains.

With Orbitz or OTAs, you see many airlines schedules and prices, with airlines' websites, you see only those airlines, you are fixed on only one airline, unless.
